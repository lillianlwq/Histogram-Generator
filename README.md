# Histogram-Generator

calculate.js contains logic to read an uploaded .csv file containing rows of student names and grades. A file handler  parses the fileâ€™s data into an appropriate JavaScript structure.

Each time the user changes the lower bounds of any of the letter grades, the Histogram dynamically adjusts itself to represent the number of students in each range.

If there is an invalid input of any kind, i.e. bounds of letter-grades overlap or a string is entered as input, then the program deals with it accordingly.

The program also dynamically generate the Stats for the course including:

  The highest grade
  
  The lowest grade
  
  The Mean grade
  
  The Median grade
